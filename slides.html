## Accessing help in R and Python

##### R and Python

- Preface a function `?` to view the documentation. e.g. ?len or ?seq. 


##### shortcuts 
- In **RStudio**, you can press `F1`  

- In **JupyterLab**, you can press `Shift` + `TAB` or have the **contextual help** open on the side as you type.

---

## Asking effective questions
#### Why even bother?
- Asking questions effectively means that the person helping you will be able to answer your question **better and quicker**.

- When you are asking for help online, remember that you are often receiving help from people who are **volunteering their time**. 

---

You might be frustrated by a problem...

Don't do this.
No one will help you.
You will get more frustrated.

---


### Minimal reproducible example

- Use **markdown code blocks** for proper indentation and syntax highlighting.
- **Inline code** should be surrounded by **single backticks** for clarity. 


---
### Minimal reproducible example
- Describe what you have tried so far, what you don't understand or what went wrong, including any **error messages** and their full traceback.

--

- The points are elaborated on below:
- **Search for other questions similar to yours**
  
--
  - **Write the title as a summary of your issue** 
  Just "Error" or "Question" is not helpful, but "How to list content in a folder?" is.
--
  - **Introduce the problem by briefly describing what you want to do.**

---


### Minimal reproducible example

- **Show what you have tried**, explain what you expected to happen, and what went wrong. It is often critical that the person helping you can reproduce the problem, so include both the code or command you tried to run and the error message.
- For coding questions, **text is preferred over a screenshot** since it is easy to copy and paste, which facilitates **reproducing** your problem.


---

### Minimal reproducible example

- **Include versions of any packages you are using**, and the operating system if relevant, e.g. Win10, Python 3.8, pandas 1.0.2. 


#### R 
`devtools::session_info()` to see this information 
(after `install.packages("devtools")`) 


#### Python 
`sinfo()` 
(after importing: from `sinfo` import `sinfo`, needs to be installed via `pip install sinfo`).

---

### Minimal reproducible example

- **When your problem is solved, acknowledge the solution**, close the issue/ticket/question. If you found the solution yourself, post it in a comment before closing, so that others can find it.

## Virtual environments

---

## Virtual environments

- You can have multiple versions of packages and programs on the same computer without them creating conflicts with each other.


- You will be using virtual **Python** and **R environments** throughout the program to setup your packages for different courses.

---

## Conda 

- **conda** is an **open source package** and **environment management system** for any programming language

- It is the most popular in the python community. 

&lt;img src="img/conda.png" width="300" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## Conda

- **Anaconda** is a data science platform for Python that comes with a lot of packages by default. 
- **Miniconda** doesn't come with any installed packages by default, and we can pick and choose which ones we want. 

Both include Python and conda.

## Managing Conda


What version of conda is installed?

```bash
conda --version
```
Conda commands are available, type conda --help. 

```bash
conda update --help
```
- Update our conda to the latest version: 

```bash
conda update conda
```

### What is a conda environment and why is it so useful?
Using conda, you can create an `isolated python environment for your project`. 


---

## What is an Environment?
- An environment is a set of packages that can be used in one or multiple projects.

--
##### **Benefits** of using environments:
  - You can guarantee that someone else can **reproduce your project** by specifying which package versions your used.
--
  - If two of your projects relies on different versions of the same package, you can install these in **different environments**.
--
  - If you want to play around with a **new package**, you don't have to change the packages you use for your data analysis and risk messing something up.
--
  - When you **develop your own packages**, it is essential to use environments, since you want to to make sure you know exactly which packages yours depend on, so that it runs on other systems than your own.


---

## Base environment

Conda has a default environment called **base**
- that include a Python installation and
- some core system libraries and dependencies of Conda. 

It is a **“best practice”** to avoid installing additional packages into your base software environment. 
 

---

## Creating Conda environments

There are two ways of creating a conda environment.

1. Creating environment by manually specifying packages  

--
2. An environment file in YAML format (*environment.yaml*).

---

## Creating Conda environments
#### 1. Creating environment by manually specifying packages
We can create `test_env` conda environment by typing `conda -n &lt;name-of-env&gt;`. 

```bash
conda create -n test_env -c conda-forge python=3.7 jupyterlab pandas=1.0.2
```
- conda will solve any dependencies between the packages like before and create a new environment with those packages. 
- Usually, we don't need to specify the channel, but in this case I want to get the very latest version of these packages, and they are made available in `conda-forge` before they reach the default conda channel.

---
## Creating Conda environments
#### 1. Creating environment by manually specifying packages

To activate this new environment, you can type

```bash
conda activate test_env 
```

```bash
conda deactivate 
```

To see all your environments, you can type:

```bash
conda env list
```
---
## Creating Conda environments
#### 2. An environment file in YAML format (*environment.yaml*).

Exporting your environment to a file called `environment.yaml` (it could be called anything, but this is the conventional name and using it makes it easy for others to recognize that this is a conda env file, the extension can be either .yaml or .yml):

---


## Sharing Environments with others
Export your conda environment to an environment file, which will list each package and its version.


```bash
conda env export -f environment.yaml
```
Remember that `.yaml` files are plain text, so you can use a text editor such as VS Code to open them. 


---
## Sharing Environments with others
The environment file has A LOT more packages than jupyterlab and pandas. 

list the dependencies that were installed together with these packages, e.g. numpy. 

This is good in the sense that it gives an **exact copy of everything in your environment**.


---

## Sharing Environments with others

Exporting your environment to a file called **environment.yaml** (the extension can be either `.yaml` or `.yml`):

```bash
conda env export -f environment.yaml
```
---
## Sharing Environments with others
Some dependencies might differ between operating systems,append the 
`--from-history flag` which look at the history of the packages you explicitly told conda to install and only list those in the export. 

The required dependencies will then be handled in an **OS-specific manner during the installation**, which guarantees that they will work across OSes. 

This `environment.yaml` file would be much shorter:

```bash
name: test_env
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - conda
  - python=3.7
  - pandas==1.0.2
  - jupyterlab
```
Importantly, this will not include the package version unless you included it when you installed with the package==version syntax. 

##### For an environment to be reproducible, you NEED to add the version string manually.

---
### Creating environment from an environment file
Now, let's install `environment.yaml` environment file above so that we can create a conda environment called `test_env`.
```bash
$ conda env create --file environment.yaml
```
---

## Copying an environment

We can make an exact copy of an environment to an environment with a different name. This maybe useful for any testing versus live environments or different Python 2.7 versions for the same packages. In this example, test_env is cloned to create live_env.
```bash
conda create --name live_env --clone test_env
```

---
## Deleting an environment
Since we are only testing out our environment, we will delete live_env.
```bash
conda env remove -n live_env
```

---

## Making environments work well with JupyterLab
In brief, you need to install the `ipykernel` package in any new environment your create, and the nb_conda_kernels package needs to be installed in the environment where JupyterLab is installed.

By default, JupyterLab only sees the conda environment where it is installed. Since it is quite annoying to install JupyterLab and its extensions separately in each environment, there is a package called nb_conda_kernels that makes it possible to have a single installation of JupyterLab access kernels in other conda environments. This package needs to be installed in the conda environment where JupyterLab is installed.

Lastly, you also need to install a kernel in the new conda environment so that it can be detected by nb_conda_kernels. This kernel can be installed via the package ipykernel for Python and the r-irkernel package for R (more info in the nb_conda_kernels README).
---
## Managing Packages
#### Seeing what packages are available
We will now check packages that are available to us. The command below will list all the packages in an environment, in this case test_env. The list will include versions of each package, the specific build, and the channel that the package was downloaded from. conda list is also useful to ensure that you have installed the packages that you desire.

```bash
conda list
```

```bash
# packages in environment at //miniconda/envs/test_env:
#

Searching for a certain package
```
Some packages might not be available in conda, but are available in `pypi`. For example, we will search for rasterio within the anaconda cloud. It is not necessary to create an account with anaconda cloud, unless you'd like to contribute in the future when you are pro with conda.


---
## Managing Packages
In this example, we will use `rasterio` from `conda-forge`. 

With conda you can do this search within the command line:
```
conda search rasterio
```

## Managing conda

Under the name column of the result in the terminal or the package column in the Anaconda Cloud listing, shows the necessary information to install the package. e.g. conda-forge/rasterio. The first word list the channel that this package is from and the second part shows the name of the package.

To install the latest version available within the channel, do not specify in the install command. We will install version 0.35 of rasterio from conda-forge into test_env in this example. Conda will also automatically install the dependencies for this package.
```
conda install -c conda-forge rasterio=0.35
```
If you have a few trusted channels that you prefer to use, you can pre-configure these so that everytime you are creating an environment, you won't need to explicitly declare the channel.
```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

---
### Removing a conda Package
Note that this will remove the main package `rasterio` and its dependencies (unless a dependency was installed explicitly at an earlier point in time or is required be another package).
```
conda remove -n test_env rasterio
```
```
Using Anaconda Cloud api site https://api.anaconda.org
Fetching package metadata .........
Solving package specifications: ..........

Package plan for package removal in environment //anaconda/envs/test_env:

The following packages will be REMOVED:

    rasterio: 0.35.1-np111py27_1 conda-forge

Proceed ([y]/n)? y

Unlinking packages ...
[      COMPLETE      ]|#######################################################################################################| 100%

```
Remeber that when you forget a specific command you can type in the help command we have created mds-help in you terminal to see a list of all commands we use in MDS.

## R

**`renv` package**

&lt;img src="img/renv.png" width="300" /&gt;
.footnote[[Reproducible Environments - RStudio](https://environments.rstudio.com/)]
---

# `renv` package

1. 🏁 `renv::init()` works by creating a new library. A library stores installed packages.

--

2. 📸 `renv::snapshot()` creates a new file in your project titled `renv.lock`. The file contains all the information you need to communicate your project’s dependencies at the moment you call snapshot. 

--
3. 🌱 `renv::restore()` recreates the environment!
